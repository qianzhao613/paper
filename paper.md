# Introduction
Epigentic clock is a predictive model.

DNA methylation was measured by RRBS (Stubbs et al 2008).

Tamir et al (2023) conducted an average methylation study,
but the problem is still here.

DNA methylation is quiet important.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of DNA methylation as they are transfered from source region.

# Methodology
We compared our measurements of DNA methylation-related aging with a model simulation.
The model is detailed in Horvith et al 2012.

# Results
DNA methylation can be used for the construction of aging predictor.

# Figures
Figures go in their own section in a draft paer.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the aging process.
Nonethelss, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.

#Added bits
:)
